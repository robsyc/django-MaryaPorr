        I'm <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/maryam-imbumi-11113b79/" target="_blank">Maryam Imbumi</a>, the founder of MaryaNutri. 
        As a Kenyan-born nutritionist and PhD student at Ghent University, 
        I'm on a mission to end childhood malnutrition. 
        I know this cause personally - I was born in Kenya and almost died twice as a child due to severe malnutrition...

      <p class="my-4 my-md-5">
        At MaryaNutri, we're creating unique, innovative insect-fortified foods that are nutritious and sustainable.
        Our goal is not just temporary relief, but lasting change to end poverty and hunger around the world. 
        With roots in Kenya and our eyes on the global stage, we're working to make a real difference.
